megastrata
==========

An abandoned experiment that allows you to explore noise patterns.

Read all about this project [on the Megastructure development blog](http://blog.megastructure.org/noiseviewer-information-and-downloads/). You'll also find readily-compiled binaries for download.

This was a tiny pet project that ballooned into a simple "megastructure simulator". It became too cumbersome to add features, and it was abandoned in 2009.

Thanks to [Wolfgang](https://twitter.com/wolfgaggle) for the OS X port.
